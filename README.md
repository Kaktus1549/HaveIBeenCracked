# About HaveIBeenCracked

## What is HaveIBeenCracked?

HaveIBeenCracked is an open-source project designed to help users understand the importance of secure passwords, particularly for WiFi networks. By searching for a WiFi network's SSID or BSSID in a database of pwned WiFi networks, users can quickly check if their network has been compromised. The database includes the SSID, BSSID, and the time when the network was first flagged. The goal is to encourage better security practices, such as avoiding weak passwords like "00000" that are easily cracked.

## Why I Created It

I was inspired by the popular service HaveIBeenPwned, which alerts users if their personal information has been exposed in data breaches. While HaveIBeenPwned focuses on personal data, I noticed a gap when it came to WiFi networks. Many people still use weak or default passwords for their WiFi, making them easy targets for attackers. I created HaveIBeenCracked to show people that WiFi security is not just a "cool word" but an essential part of protecting their privacy and devices.

## How to Use HaveIBeenCracked

Using HaveIBeenCracked is simple. You can search for your WiFi network by either its SSID (WiFi name) or BSSID (the unique identifier of the WiFi router). Once you search, the tool checks the database for any records of compromised networks. If your network is listed, it means it was found online with weak security settings, and you should update your WiFi password to something more secure immediately.
